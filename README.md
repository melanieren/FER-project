# FER-project

This repository contains the code for our CS 486 class project, which aims to compare different CNN techniques for recognizing facial emotions. 

Two types of CNNs were explored and compared:
1. A simple CNN based on the architecture proposed in the paper [Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/abstract/document/8981757) by Zeynab Rzayeva and Emin Alasgarov
2. A ResNet based on the architecture proposed in the paper [Facial Sentiment Classification Based on Resnet-18 Model](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8990979&tag=1) by Yitao Zhou, Shun Nishide, Fuji Ren, and Xin Kang

## Datasets 
- [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data): The FER-2013 dataset was used to train and evaluate both types of models. 
- [MSFDE](http://www.psychophysiolab.com/en/download.php): The Montreal Set of Facial Displays of Emotion (MSFDE) dataset was used to evaluate both types of models, in order to investigate potential racial bias in the model predictions.
